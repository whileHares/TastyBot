TastyBot is a Discord bot developed for the management and display of food offers.
The bot allows users to create offers, display them in specific channels, express interest and delete offers.
The application is divided into several classes that cover different aspects of bot functionality.
TastyBot uses the so-called "service layer patterns".
Modern Java applications use this structure in combination of Java with the Spring Framework and Hibernate.
Our design follows proven practices such as Separation of Concerns and Single Responsibility. 
This enables clear structuring of the code, facilitates maintenance and testability of the application and supports scalability when adding new functions.
We chose the topic of foodwaste, because of its balanced impact on social, economic and ecological aspects.
